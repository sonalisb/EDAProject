Components
------------

1. **Problem Statement**

> After collecting some initial questions, I came up with a hypothetical problem: In 2017, a certain production company, ABC decides to produce movies that will earn the best in terms of revenue, popularity and acclaim. This company approaches agency, XYZ and asks them to come up with characteristics of movies that will help them achieve their purpose. 

2. **Data Wrangling**

> I gathered the data, examined and cleaned it to make it ready for EDA. 

3. **Questions and EDA**

> Then I added more questions that aligns with the Problem Statement. Used these questions to explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualization. Noted down my findings from the exploration.

4. **Conclusion**

> I drew conclusions from my data exploration in this section.

5. **Actionable Insights**

> In this section, I came up with actionable insights from the exploration and conclusion to solve the Problem Statement.

6. **Communicate**

> Finally, I communicated my results through Presentation and Voice Overlay.
